# MySchedualer - Project Summary

## What We've Built

MySchedualer is a comprehensive smart scheduling application that automatically organizes academic assignments, class schedules, and work commitments into an optimized Google Calendar. Here's what has been implemented:

### üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with distinct modules for APIs, models, core logic, and configuration
- **Python 3.9+**: Modern Python with type hints and Pydantic models
- **FastAPI Ready**: Structured for easy web interface development

### üìö **Data Models**
- **Assignment Model**: Comprehensive assignment representation with priority, difficulty, and time estimation
- **Schedule Model**: Flexible time block management with conflict detection
- **Work Schedule Model**: Integration-ready work shift representation
- **Course Model**: Canvas course information structure

### üß† **Smart Scheduling Engine**
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Assignments are prioritized by urgency score and due date
- **Time Optimization**: Intelligent distribution of tasks across available time slots
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of overlapping time blocks
- **Break Management**: Smart insertion of breaks between study sessions
- **Efficiency Scoring**: Metrics for schedule optimization

### üîå **API Integrations**
- **Canvas LMS API**: Full integration for fetching assignments, courses, and due dates
- **Google Calendar API**: Complete calendar management with OAuth2 authentication
- **Sling API Ready**: Framework in place for work schedule integration
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new data sources

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration & Settings**
- **Environment-Based Config**: Secure credential management
- **Customizable Preferences**: Study hours, session durations, break times
- **Timezone Support**: Proper timezone handling for scheduling
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### üéØ **Key Features**
- **Automatic Assignment Import**: Pulls all assignments from Canvas
- **Smart Time Estimation**: AI-like duration estimation based on assignment type and complexity
- **Priority Calculation**: Dynamic urgency scoring based on due dates and importance
- **Calendar Integration**: Posts optimized schedule directly to Google Calendar
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Respects existing commitments (classes, work)
- **Break Optimization**: Ensures healthy study patterns with appropriate breaks

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### 1. **Data Collection Phase**
```
Canvas API ‚Üí Assignments + Due Dates
Sling API ‚Üí Work Schedule + Availability  
Manual Input ‚Üí Class Schedule + Fixed Events
```

### 2. **Analysis Phase**
```
Calculate Urgency Scores
Estimate Time Requirements
Identify Available Time Slots
Prioritize by Due Date + Importance
```

### 3. **Scheduling Phase**
```
Distribute Tasks Optimally
Add Breaks & Buffer Time
Resolve Conflicts
Optimize for Efficiency
```

### 4. **Output Phase**
```
Generate Daily Schedules
Post to Google Calendar
Set Reminders & Notifications
Color-Code by Activity Type
```
